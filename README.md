# AI-PacMan

This project was one of my assignments of the course CSE 571: Artificial Intelligence. 

This project is composed of two parts:
* search 
* multiagents 

## Search
In this project, the Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. A general search algorithms is built and is applied to the Pacman scenarios.
### Files that were edited: 
* search.py
* searchagents.py

## Multiagents 
In this project, you will design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts.  Along the way, you will implement both minimax and expectimax search and try your hand at evaluation function design.

### Files that were edited:
* multiAgents.py


## What you will need to run:
* Python 2.7 

## How to run:
A detailed description is provided in each of the directories.


## Reference 
This project is similar to AI Berkeley project 1 and 2. For more details, refer this link [UC Berkeley PROJECTS](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)
